# 2D_Medical_Image_Segmentation_Workshop
This repository contains an educational notebook that walks the audience through an example 2D medical segmentation project using PyTorch and Monai.
Please open the notebook and proceed through the code (you could also load it in Google Colabatory).

We will train a U-Net deep learning model to segment the lungs from chest radiographs. Our output will look like the following:
